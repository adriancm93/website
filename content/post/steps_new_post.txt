Steps to create a new post (personal):

1- Create a folder with a new post in the following path:
	C:\Users\adrian-boss\Documents\GitHub\website\content\post

2- inside such folder, create a jupyter notebook file called index

3- In the terminal, change directory to new folder, example (new_post is the name of the fodler I created in step 2):
	cd C:\Users\adrian-boss\Documents\GitHub\website\content\post\new_post

4- Run the following command:
	jupyter lab index.ipynb

5- Edit jupyter notebook to create a post
	Don't add images yet (personal preference)
	Don't add code yet (personal preference)

6 - Inside the working directory, run the following code in the command prompt:
	jupyter nbconvert index.ipynb --to markdown --NbConvertApp.output_files_dir=.

7- Add featured image on the working folder (featured.jpg)

8- Go to index.md to add images and code 
	Start and end chunks of code with: (```  ```)
	Insert images stored on working fodler, example: ![png](./plot.png)
