Steps to create a new post (personal):

1- Create a folder with a new post in the following path:
	C:\Users\adrian-boss\Documents\GitHub\website\content\post

2- inside such folder, create a jupyter notebook file called index

3- In the terminal, change directory to new folder, example (new_post is the name of the fodler I created in step 2):
	cd C:\Users\adrian-boss\Documents\GitHub\website\content\post\new_post

4- Run the following command:
	jupyter lab index.ipynb

5- Edit jupyter notebook to create a post
	Don't add images yet (personal preference)
	Don't add code yet (personal preference)

Edit your post metadata
The first cell of your Jupter notebook will contain your post metadata (front matter).

In Jupter, choose Markdown as the type of the first cell and wrap your Academic metadata in three dashes, indicating that it is YAML front matter:

---
title: My post's title
date: 2019-09-01

# Put any other Academic metadata here...
---

6 - Inside the working directory, run the following code in the command prompt:
	jupyter nbconvert index.ipynb --to markdown --NbConvertApp.output_files_dir=.

7- Add featured image on the working folder (featured.jpg)

8- Go to index.md to add images and code 
	Start and end chunks of code with: (```  ```)
	Insert images stored on working fodler, example: ![png](./plot.png)
