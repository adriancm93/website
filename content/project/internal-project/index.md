In this project, I am predicting the probability of a pass being completed. I'll build a classification model utilizing a Gradient Boosting Algorithm. The goal will be to evaluate the prediction error (outcome â€“ the likelihood of completion) to assess how much a passer over-or-underperformed in a given pass. Finally, I will be estimating the mean residual, which we call Completion Percentage Over Expectation (CPOE) for each QB during a period.
