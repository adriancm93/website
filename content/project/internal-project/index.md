In this project, I am predicting the probability of a pass being completed. I will be using a classifying algorithm called Gradient Boosting for this purpose. Increasing the accuracy of prediction is what I want for the model. Still, I am more interested in the estimated probabilities rather than the predicted outcome. I will evaluate the prediction error (outcome â€“ prob. of completion) to assess how much a passer over or underperformed in a given pass. Finally, I will be estimating the mean residual (which we call CPOE) for each QB during 2019.
