abstract: Michael Lopez posted not long ago a great article explaining how Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are a good way to measure non-linear effects of explanatory variables x on response variable y. Lately, Iâ€™ve been playing around with linear and logistic mixed-effects models, so I thought about combining these with GAMs to estimate the probability of completion per Quarterback while accounting for non-linearities, especially on air yards.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Case study on how to leverage Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMM) to estimate the individual probability of completion per Quarterback as a random effect.
